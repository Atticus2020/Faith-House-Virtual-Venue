The Faith House Virual Venue is built to visualize what it is like to experience the physical experience itself. It was built in development with Unity 3D with C#, source control, and focused on realistic lighting, animation, interior and exterior desing, and heavily focused on immersion.

Rendered at high setting settings with Unity's URP Rendering Pipeline, the project was built with expertise and care.

Here are Renderings of the Virtual Venue itself.
